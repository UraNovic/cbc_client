# cbc Trade client

## Overview
The cbc Trade client is an open-source GUI for the cbc network that facilitates the peer-to-peer exchange of any store of value. Itâ€™s the only platform where you can trade between stores of value spanning fiat, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and unusual assets like pre-1965 silver dimes.

[cbc Labs](https://cbclabs.com) is the core team behind the project. For more information on the cbc protocol, please visit our [wiki](https://cbc.com/wiki/).

We would love to have folks contribute! Check out our bounties [here](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/cbc/bounties).

cbc Trade is available at www.cbctrade.com.


## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Install Node.js, Gulp, Git and Python 2 if you haven't already.

Install bower by running `sudo bower install --allow-root`.

Fork and clone the cbc-client repository and run `npm install`.

Create a new config.js file and copy/paste from config-example.js into the same directory.

### Build

Run 'gulp' in your command line for development.

Run 'gulp dist' for the production ready client.

Your web client is in the 'build/dist/' directory.

### Target backend

By default, the [cbc.txt](https://wiki.cbc.com/cbc.txt) file is pointed at the staging server.
__This means you will only be able to log in on your dev environment with an account created on [staging.cbctrade.com](https://staging.cbctrade.com).__

If you want to point your environment at the production server:
- set the authinfo_url in cbc.txt (in the root of the repo directory) to: `https://id.cbc.com/v1/authinfo` (make sure to rebuild + clear browser cache)
- set the `activate_link` property in config.js to `https://cbctrade.com/#/register/activate`
